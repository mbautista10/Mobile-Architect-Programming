**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The app is required to create a first-time user registration button. Second, after the registration, the user should be allowed to enter their username and password. Third, the user should enter his information to be saved. For example, name, gender, date of birth, start weight, and target weight and be displayed in a grid. Finally, the user had the option to allow permission to send SMS messaging. The final goal of the app is to allow users to save weight information.  

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

There were several required screens. The first screen had username and password fields. In addition, it had a button where new users would register. When the user pressed the button, his credentials were saved and immediately returned to the login screen. There he would log in to enter his weight information. That third screen allowed the user to enter his personal information into the database; the user could update, view, and delete the data by pressing the buttons. Finally, when the user pressed the view button, a grid with information was supposed to be displayed. The design could have been successful if it didnâ€™t crash. However, the layout was simple to use. 

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

My approach to coding was simple. For example, after the design was completed, I would start using techniques the book taught us. Also, I started by coding one class and continued to the other one as necessary. 

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

Honestly, my testing techniques were not great. I made a mistake where I had written a lot of code, and in the end, the application did not run as expected. However, I learned an important lesson, testing must be implemented in blocks to prevent a messy debugging process. 

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

Considering the complete app design and development process to overcome challenges in the registration process, I had user resources like YouTube to understand the concept better. In addition, the book came in very handy. 

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

The login and registration screens successfully demonstrated my knowledge, skills, and experience. In addition, the code worked as expected, and the app did not crash.
